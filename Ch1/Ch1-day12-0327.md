For the flow
$$
\textbf{u}(x,y,t) = \left(u_1(x,t),0,0\right)
$$
and the equation
$$
\textbf{u}_t + (\textbf{u}\cdot \nabla)\textbf{u} = -\frac{\nabla p}{\rho}
$$
becomes
$$
u_{1,t} + u_1\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x} = -\frac{p_x}{\rho_{0}}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
u_{1,t} + u_1u_{1,x} = -\frac{p_x}{\rho_{0}}
$$
with the incompressibility $\operatorname{div}\textbf{u} = u_{1,x} = 0$, we have 
$$
u_{1,t} = -\frac{p_x}{\rho_{0}}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
p_x = -\rho_{0} u_{1,t}
$$
Notice that
$$
p_{xx} = -\rho_{0} u_{1,t,x} = -\rho_{0} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_{1,x} = 0
$$
so that the pressure $p$ is given by
$$
p_{x,x} = 0 
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
p_{x} = C_1
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
p(x) = C_1 x + C_2,
$$
where $C_1,C_2$ is constant.

Plugin the boundary condition
$$
\begin{cases}
p(x=0) = p(0) = p_1 = C_2\\
p(x=L) = p(L) = p_2 = C_1L+p_1
\end{cases},\quad\Rightarrow\quad
C_2 = \frac{p_2-p_1}{L}
$$
solving that the pressure
$$
p(x) = p_1 + \left(p_2-p_1\right)\frac{x}{L}
$$
or
$$
p(x) = \frac{(1-x)p_1 + xp_2}{L}.
$$
Notice that $p_x = (p_2-p_1)/L$, we can solve that 
$$
u_{1,t} = \frac{p_2-p_1}{L\rho}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
u_{1}(t) = \frac{p_2-p_1}{L\rho} t + C_3,
$$
for some constant $C_3$.

This is because we have ignored frictional force in the modelling. This situation will be remedied by the "*Navier-Stokes equation*", which take account for friction force later.
